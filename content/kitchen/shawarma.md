Title: Soy curl shawarma with fresh rosemary pita

I was aiming for a nice summer lunch, not too light, with some density. Also
definitely overdone on the focaccia and olive oil lately, and I've been
refining the mediterranean. I've done a similar menu sucessfully with kefte,
but this was my first time trying out the shawarma, and it worked out with
incredible success and positive reviews.

### Soy curl shawarma

A new and excellent use of [soy curls](https://www.butlerfoods.com) for me!

Soaked and drained soy curls with a press; then, added lots of oil --- not
enough to immerse, but enough for a generous coat. I covered curls with a salty
powdered chicken broth and a touch of soy sauce to get a chicken-y atmosphere,
and then seasoned liberally with notes from a [cauliflower shawarma
recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023019-cauliflower-shawarma-with-spicy-tahini); my own additions were kasuri methi, garam masala, and kashmiri red chili
powder. I let the whole situation marinate overnight, and then sauteed on
med-high.

The key, however, was **braising with chickën broth** during the cook.
Normally, fried soy curls are a touch too dry, but letting them marinate in
watery liquid makes them soggy. Loosening up the pan with a splash of chickën
broth every so often kept the curls tender and not like fried-crispy dry, which
I think is what you want for shawarma. They also didn't get soggy/absorb too
much water, just stayed perfectly moist. Definitely doing this technique again
for other things!



### Pita

[NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016071-homemade-pita-bread): make
a sponge w 2tsp yeast, a touch of sugar, 1 c. water, and ¼ c. each whole wheat
and apf. Let it get frothy for ~15 mins before adding ~2¼ c. apf, 1 tsp. salt,
2 tbsp. evoo; knead a bit, then let it rise for an hour or so. Make balls, roll
them out with a pin, 475 on a baking stone for ~3 mins with a flip.


I had some extra rosemary so I threw in some needles. There weren't a ton (it
should have been more rosemary-y) but the occasional touch of rosemary was
lovely. This is the first time I've also had the pocket form beautifully!
Definitely the stovetop does not work for that, you need the oven and a hot
stone/surface underneath.


One idea for the future is a tepla pita; seasoning it well with some kasuri
methi and other things I think would be nice.


### Chopped Salad + Hummus

Apart from this I did a quick cucumber, tomato, and olive salad with pickled
onions and a lemony hummus. Nothing fancy there, but good complements for the
meal.

Another nice touch was some leftover oil from confit tomatoes that was heavenly
poured over the top of little pita pockets; would highly recommend!
