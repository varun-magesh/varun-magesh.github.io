Title: Potato chorizo tacos

I wanted to try the Delirio salsa that Andy brought and Cody's tortilla press!
This was also a good opportunity to use the dregs of soy curls, the little
pieces left over apart from the big strips.

I cut the potatoes relatively small and seasoned with lots of oil and seasoned
them slightly in the indian way, with turmeric, cumin, and kashmiri chili. I
seasoned the soy curls more like a smoky chorizo, with smoked paprika, a bit of
soy sauce, garlic, chili, chopped jalapenos, and lots of oil. I cheated with
the chili powder and smoked paprika; if I had more time, it would be whole
arbol and guajillos. I did the saut√©e & braise technique for the curls while
air frying the potatoes, and then mixed the two together in the end.

I made the tortillas with the standard instructions on the package. One
important lesson is that the final warming step really matters; it's the slight
steaming in their own heat that makes the tortillas nice and flexible and not
weird and slightly crunchy in a bad way.

I cut the heat and warmth of the potato + chorizo with sweet pickled red onions
(in the classic way, with red wine vinegar) and a bit of crema made by mixing
v. yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. I topped everything off with a few
drops of the Delirio.

The potato + pickled onion combination was slighlty reminescent of a pizza
combination from Golden State pizza. It works incredibly well.

Overall, these were not the most picturesque, but incredible. The lightly sweet
warm corn, the spicy heat and creamy texture of the potatoes, the burn of the
delirio, and the acidity and sweetness of the pickled onion all came together
beatifully. It sounds like it would be overwhelming, but truly it was
excellent. Do this again! Would be perfect with some mellow refried beans and
rice.


### On tacos

A brief opportunity to elaborate on tacos. I'm no expert, but I've had tacos I
like, and tacos I don't like. This is my attempt to describe them. There are
two kinds of tacos, the tex-mex kind, and the street kind. A tex-mex taco is on
a larger tortilla, sometimes flour, sometimes on a crunchy shell, and generally
has ground or strip meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and tomato salsa. Note I
pass no judgement here. I am in no position to evaluate authenticity, and I
don't tend to focus on it; for the purposes of this reflection, something is
good to eat, or it isn't. Tex-mex tacos are good, but to me, they feel a bit
more like lite burritos, and are often somewhat polain and predictable.

My favorite kind of street taco is on smaller, always soft, slightly greasy
corn tortillas, often double layered. The taco always centers on the _meat_ --
I use this in Miyoko's broad sense; a culinary meat; something substantial,
dense, and very strongly seasoned or marinated. It should be warm, hearty,
spicy. Sometimes, like al pastor, it can be sweet, and have some pineapple
chunks. The texture should be pleasant and weighty, I don't think I've ever
seen a street taco with ground meat. It should be bold, and too bold to just
eat by itself with a spoon; it needs to be balanced and cut. Here comes the
tortilla; soft, with a mild, pleasant corn flavor, and touched with grease.
There should be a thoughtful garnish on top that complements the _meat_. I
would avoid a store-bought or standard salsas like the plague; a plain sprinkle
of lime, cilantro, and chopped white onions if available is far preferable.
These ingredients do not overpower the meat or introduce new centers of their
own; they complement and cut the boldness to make the center more enjoyable.

Think like a little bit like chole bhatura. The chole is strong; much stronger
than chole in other contexts. It's extra spicy, extra greasy. It's definitely
too rich by itself; it needs to be cut with lemon, raw onions, and spread over
carbs. That's what the center of a street taco should be like. In fact, in
Trinidad, chole is used in something similar to a street taco. They call it
doubles, and it's delicious.

I like street tacos a lot because they are entertaining canvases for unique and
bold combinations, where all is in service of the perfect bite, rather than a
formulaic combination of a handful of familiar elements.

Here's some suggestions for good combinations I've enjoyed making in the past:
- potato and chorizo, with pickled onions and crema
- roasted cauliflower al pastor (really let the florets burn and caramelize a
  bit) with a pineapple salsa
- jackfruit carnitas with onions + cilantro topping
- braised cremini mushrooms with pickled cabbage and queso fresco, on a fried,
  cheese dusted tortilla

tacos I've had that I want to make:
- chole with cucumber salsa and tamarind chutney, on bara (doubles, from
  shadobeni)
- chewy seitan and with crispy fried onions and tomatillo salsa (saluhall)
- dry oyster mushroom carnitas with tomatillo salsa, white onions, and pickled
  radishes (saluhall)
- black bean mole with pickled onions and crema (san diego)
- al pastor soy-things with mango and cucumber (san diego)
- something red and spicy with onions (san diego)
