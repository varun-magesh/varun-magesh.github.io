Title: Focaccia, confit tomatoes, and a summer salad

I wanted a summer lunch that was impressive but relatively hands off; I would
have at most ~20 minutes of active time before serving. I love tomato season,
and I've been really into confit tomatoes recently, so I organized around nice
things to go with those.

**Focaccia** ([NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021036-focaccia?algo=cooking_search_relevance_metric_ios_and_web&fellback=false&imp_id=8359099581733063&req_id=764298173660429&surface=cooking-search-web&variant=0_relevance_reranking)): 415 grams flour, 420 grams water, 1/2 tsp yeast, 1 tbsp salt; overnight in the fridge, and 2 hours before in the pan. Brush with olive oil, indent with fingers, top with salt, and bake at 450 for ~30-40 minutes until golden brown.

The one problem I've been having recently with focaccias in glass is sticking; this
time and last I've had to pry hard to get it out, even with generous olive oil.
I recall focaccia-type pizzas coming out nicely from the cast iron, so maybe I should
try there. Another option is parchment paper, though I worry that will also end up
sticking and there will be scraps of paper in the bread.

For the salad, I wanted something summery and lighter to contrast the bread.
Tart, but with a source of acidity that wasn't tomatoes.

**White bean salad**: White beans and a little rotini tossed in a basil & sunflower seed pesto mixed with Trader Joe's vegan yogurt, topped with thinly sliced cucumber, olives, and nice pickled onions.

I really liked the pesto + yogurt combination; it's something creamier that's
not as heavy as mayonnaise. However, I don't think the sunflower seeds worked
well with the pesto --- fine in a pinch without pine nuts/walnuts on hand, but
they imparted a kind of unpleasant musty taste. Maybe it's just these ones
specifically, they've been sitting in the pantry for a while.

Overall, this was excellent; the focaccia and confit definitely stole the show, but
the salad was still appreciated. Cooked for three and didn't end with many leftovers.

The salad was also the right counterpoint to the focaccia on a hot day; the dressing
was also good mopped up with the nice bread.
