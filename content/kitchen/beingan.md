Title: Beingan Bartha

This beingan bartha is based on the best of Naan Stop, in Isla Vista. It
differs somewhat than the classic you would see at a North Indian place like,
e.g. Chaat Bhavan. It's smokier, less acidic, and has a touch of sweetness.
Unlike my chana recipe or rajma, it doesn't have floral cardamom/star anise
frangrances; it's more rich and spicy. It _omits_ tomatoes and ginger, which
some recipies have.

## Ingredients

1. 0.5-1 eggplant per person. The large purple American eggplant works better
   over the small Indian eggplants for this one.
2. 0.5-1 onion per person, pref. red but variety doesn't super matter
3. Green chillies
4. Garlic
5. Kashmiri red chili powder or regular red chili powder
6. Garam masala (semi-optional)
7. Bay leaves (semi-optional)
8. Salt
9. Brown sugar
10. Touch of liquid smoke or smoked paprika (optional)

## Process

I think ideally you grill the eggplants for smokiness, but I've never had the
chance to do this with a grill. What I do is a bit of a cheat. Cut 4 slits in
the eggplant; stuff the slits with whole garlic cloves and halved green chilis
(4 cloves + 1 green chili per eggplant). Leave the skin of the eggplant on. Rub
the whole thing generously with salt and oil. Roast the eggplant in the oven
at 425. It'll take like an hour, don't rush it. By the end, the eggplant should be
fork tender, almost mushy even. The garlic cloves should also be roasted and
soft.

While they roast, caramelize the onions. Batched could be faster if it's for a
big group. They should be sweet and brown. Salt while you caramelize, and throw
in a bay leaf or two and some green chili (depending on how spicy you want
things) into the pot after the onions. Add some chili powder and a generous
amount of oil as well at this stage to let the chili, oil, and onion infuse a
bit.

When the eggplants are done, let them cool a bit, and then peel them/scoop out
the insides. Add the eggplant insides, chili, and garlic all to the main onion
pot and mix everything around. Throw in the frozen peas as well. Add a little
brown sugar, and a dash of liquid smoke or smoked paprika to simulate a char.

You're essentially done. At this stage, your main controls are:
- salt
- lemon
- liquid smoke/paprika
- brown sugar
- chili powder

Tweak these as necessary to get the right smoky, rich, salty, slightly sweet
flavor.
