    <h2> Butter chicken for a crowd </h2>
 
  </header>
  <p><img alt="soy curls" src="https://varun-magesh.github.io/images/butter-chicken.png"></p>
<p>This (vegan, ofc) butter chicken situation is my default option for feeding a
crowd on short notice. It's stripped down to the real minimum you need; there's
no marinade and no chopping involved at all, making it quick and easy to scale.
It's made with only pantry ingredients, meaning that you can do (for better and
worse) without fresh vegetables or a trip to the grocery, and it's aseasonal
and cheap. It's also incredibly forgiving. I think it's hard to quite nail and
I'm often left feeling my iteration was less than perfect, but I've never had a
bad batch or a catastrophic failure, which is the more important measure of
success when you just have a bunch of people waiting on dinner. I probably
would not make this as a dish to impress though.</p>
<p>It's meant to be a pretty broadly satisfying crowd pleaser. The final
product should be rich, warm, and creamy, with a very slight sweetness and a
pleasant spice that isn't too noticeable at first but lingers a bit as you eat.
There should be a slight, pleasant acidity as if from yogurt.</p>
<p>It's best served with basmati rice.</p>
<h2>Basic components</h2>
<p>This dish has a few basic components, each of which can be varied a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>tomato</li>
<li>fat</li>
<li>cream</li>
<li>protein</li>
<li>heat</li>
<li>spice</li>
<li>salt &amp; sugar</li>
<li>(optional) peas or kale</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll address the options for each, then discuss how they come together</p>
<h3>Tomato</h3>
<p>There are some dishes (like <a href="focaccia-confit-tomatoes-and-a-summer-salad.html">confit tomatoes</a>) I feel strongly should be made with perfect tomatoes, and shouldn't even be attempted outside of the summer months.</p>
<p>This isn't one of them. Approximately 1 16oz can of tomato per 3-4 servings (rough measures) will work. Pureed will save you some blender time, but diced, peeled, pureed, whatever -- just a can of tomato. Whole fresh tomatoes with the tops taken off will also work; they don't need to be deseeded or anything. You'll need a greater number though, since they must simmer for longer.</p>
<p>Anyway, take your tomatoes, toss them in a blender, blend till smooth. Feel free to toss a green chili pepper or an jalapeno in there if you want a bit extra heat.</p>
<p>Then, just put your sauce on the stove and start simmering it, cooking until the raw tomato smell goes away, probably ~10 minutes for a canned situation and ~20-30 for raw tomatoes I find. If you can, get some oil on before and toast a bay leaf and a clove before pouring the sauce over.</p>
<h3>Fat</h3>
<p>You will want a fat, probably vegan margarine, vegan butter, or vegan ghee. You can buy big blocks of margarine for cheap at real produce! Either way, it really doesn't matter, just has to be some sort fat.</p>
<p>One key thing you'll want to look for is that if you've made it correctly, you should se the fat split and see little traces of red oil (colored by the chili) on the surface.</p>
<h3>Cream</h3>
<p>I recommend a blend of cashew cream and coconut milk. This is helpful becaues the cashew cream thickens a lot when you cook with it and has some natural sweetness and it's so so creamy. Coconut milk is nice because it's quite rich while still having a lot of levity and not making your stomach feel so overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You can make cashew cream easily by blending 1 part cashews: 2 parts water. If you have a crappy blender, you can soak the cashews in hot water for an hour to soften them.</p>
<p>However, I've gotten away with many things --- Trader Joe's vegan heavy wipping cream and just some nice thick creamy oat milk both work just fine.</p>
<p>You want to add enough cream to get a nice orange color on the final product; in practice, I think this works out to a little less than 1:1 tomato:cream.</p>
<h3>Protein</h3>
<p>I use <a href="a-brief-treatise-on-soy-curls">soy curls</a> for my protein which is great because they're cheap and shelf stable. I follow the general practices I've previously outlined for soy curls, but I include some extra spices, mostly turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder. I also throw a bunch on a baking sheet into the oven rather than slowly sautee batches of curls over and over.</p>
<p>I think this would work well with many other vegan proteins, including a nice firm tofu or a vegan chicken. I would not recommend this with vegetables, as the sauce isn't right I think for a vegetable pairing, it's too rich and overpowering by itself so you need a protein to get out of the way. A chickpea or white bean also isn't right because the creaminess is to osimilar to the sauce.</p>
<p>If you're choosing a less permeable protein like tofu or vegan chicken, you may want to marinade, but you'll probably get by without it.</p>
<h3>Heat</h3>
<p>There are two sources of heat here: one is green chili peppers optionally blended up with the tomatoes, which are supposed to add a little bite to the sauce but not bee too spicy. The second is red, preferably kashmiri chili powder, which adds the more drawn out, background burn that you get as you eat. Season liberally with the chili powder when adding the spices.</p>
<h3>Spice</h3>
<p>This is supposed to be relatively warm and comforting, not more subtle and floral. This can be done easily with turmeric, garam masala, and chili mainly, nothing more specialty than that.</p>
<h3>Salt &amp; Sugar</h3>
<p>Getting the sugar ratio perfect is the key difficulty of some of the process. You want this to be a touch sweet without actually having it taste like sugar. I don't know that there's a consistent way to measure this, I always just try it out. But you really want the sugar to be a background thing, it's easier to over-sugar than under-suger.</p>
<h3>Peas &amp; Kale</h3>
<p>I would use a bit of finely chopped dino kale or frozen peas. I think this is a bit sacreligious to some, but I like the little bits of sweetness or varied texture and it goes with the sauce and chicken.</p>
<h2>Approximate Quantities</h2>
<p>To serve 4 just about a meal's worth, or 3 generously. This just gives you like order of magnitude approximations, much more must be done by taste</p>
<ul>
<li>1 16 fl. oz. can tomatoes</li>
<li>1.5 cups cream of some sort, could be:<ul>
<li>1 cup water and 0.5 cup cashews, blended for ~3 minutes until totally smooth and no grain is left</li>
<li>0.5 cup water, 0.25 cup cashews blended, 1 cup coconut milk</li>
<li>2 cups coconut milk, possibly some cornstarch to thicken</li>
<li>2 cups oatly, some extra fat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1-2 tbsp. salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
<li>2 tbsp. each turmeric and garam, 1 tbsp. chili powder</li>
<li>3 cups of proteins of some sort</li>
<li>1/3 cup butter or fat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Soak soy curls; put on basmati rice</li>
<li>Start cooking the blended tomato situation; cook till it stops smelling raw. You can't overcook them, so erro n the side of waiting, but it should take ~15-30 mins depending on whether you're going from can or raw.</li>
<li><a href="a-brief-treatise-on-soy-curls">Season soy curls</a>, adding a bit of turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala on top of the baseline seasoning.</li>
<li>Salt and season (over-season, because the chicken will diffuse it).</li>
<li>Add protein, stir.</li>
<li>Salt, season, and taste again.</li>
<li>Serve over basmati rice with pickled onions, if you've got some.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
