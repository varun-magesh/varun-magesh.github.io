    <h2> Creamy butternut squash pasta </h2>
 
  </header>
  <p>This is a variation on the classic cashew cream mac and cheese I've been
iterating on for a while. It depends on having nice butternut squash, so I
wouldn't recommend making it out of season --- often, off-season squash have
this odd starchy, grainy texture that persists. In season, the squash should
cook down to be incredibly soft and creamy. The notes here are warm,
savory, a bit of peppery spice, and a touch of natural sweetness from the
squash and cashews. It's best served with some charred, acidic greens to cut the
richness and mop up some of the sauce with. Roasted broccoli is easy, I also
really like a sauteed broccolini with some lemon squeezed over it.</p>
<h2>The Sauce</h2>
<p>You will need a butternut squash, a neutral oil, cashews, nutritional yeast,
apple cider vinegar, some spices, maybe some brown sugar. Optionally, a nice
olive oil to top.</p>
<p>Start with a butternut squash (I think a kabocha squash would also be good).
Remove the skins and dice it. This is relatively hard. I think the easiest way
is to cut the squash in half and scrape out the guts with a metal spoon.
Then, slice it horizontally into rounds, and then cut the skins off each round.
The skins are rather thick and bitter; a regular vegetable peeler will not get
through the whole skin.</p>
<p>Toss the cubes in a neutral oil and just a bit of salt, and throw them in the
oven at 425 for ~30-45 minutes. Toss occasionally so they cook evenly. You
should start to see a little bit of browning and caramelization by the end; if
you don't, turn up the temperature to 450-475. When they are done they should be
totally creamy inside with caramelized surfaces.</p>
<p>Add just a little bit of water, just enough to partially cover the squash, and
blend until smooth Add cashews, approximately 2 parts squash to 1 part cashews.
If your blender isn't great, you can soak the cashews in hot water for an hour
or so, but with a nice blender it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Add some apple cider vinegar for acidity and depth. Season with a few
tablespoons of nutritional yeast and lots of whole peppercorns to be
blended up; salt generously, as it will be diluted by the pasta.</p>
<p>This is the base; after this it's a bit of choose your own adventure, spice
wise. You could go brown sugar, cinnamon, and garam masala maybe, or more
savory and spicy with sichuan white pepper and white miso paste. Or you can
keep it simple with the squash alone.</p>
<p>It's okay to make some extra sauce or make the sauce ahead of time; it keeps
reasonably well in the fridge. However, the sauce mixed with pasta does not
keep well, it will dry out. If you make the sauce ahead of time or keep it, the
taste will change a bit in the fridge. Acids and salts become a bit more muted
and it'll feel a bit more thick and sweet. Just remember to taste it again and
adjust as needed.</p>
<h2>The Pasta</h2>
<p>You can take this in a few different directions. I'll give three different options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Classic homestyle: cavatappi, macaroni, or shells, cooked al dente, mixed
   with sauce.</li>
<li>Classy contrast: Rigatoni or penne, cooked separately and tossed with
   butter, pepper, and vegan parm (hit equal parts cashews, nutritional yeast,
   garlic powder, and some salt in a food processor for a parmesan powder).
   Pour sauce over the rigatoni (without mixing it); top with a nice olive oil
   drizzle and fresh ground pepper.</li>
<li>Baked crunch: Cavatappi, macaroni, or shells. Cook under al dente, so
   they're still a bit undercooked. Make the sauce a bit liquidy, and add some
   tapioca starch. Pour the pasta into a baking dish; top with sauce, then add
   a healthy layer of panko breadcrumbs and drizzle with oil. Bake at highest
   heat until crispy.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, serve with a green! This is critically important; it becomes too
rich and monotonous without it. To appreciate the sauce, you need to cut it
with something with a tougher texture and more bitter taste. Sauteed kale,
lemon broccolini, roasted broccoli, brussels sprouts, whatever. Charred bits
are great. Just something.</p>
