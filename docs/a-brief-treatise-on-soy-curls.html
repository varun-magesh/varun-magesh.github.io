    <h2> A brief treatise on soy curls </h2>
 
  </header>
  <p>I love soy curls, and not many people know what they are. Available sources do not capture my thoughts, and some (including the official docs from Butler foods) kind of set you up for mediocre soy curls, hence this brief treatise.</p>
<h3>What is a soy curl</h3>
<p>A soy curl is a little strip of dehydrated soybean. They're sold by <a href="https://www.butlerfoods.com/soy-curls.html">Butler foods</a>. Soy curls can be rehydrated to make a nice strip of protein. They are chewier than tofu but lighter and less dense than chicken. They have a relatively neutral flavor and absorb seasoning really well since they're textured and rather porous.</p>
<h3>Why I like soy curls</h3>
<p>Primarily, they're a great blank slate with an excellent texture for many kinds of things. They're cheap when bought in bulk, shelf stable, and pretty healthy.</p>
<h2>How to cook a soy curl</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fill a bowl halfway with curls</li>
<li>Pour water over the curls, totally submerging them. Let sit for ten minutes.</li>
<li>Drain excess water, <strong>and then press the curls as hard as you can (grab them in fistfuls at a time if necessary) to squeeze out as much water as possible</strong>. Butler foods does not specify this step, and if you skip it, you will have <em>incredibly</em> unpleasant curls that release a gentle squish of warm, unseasoned water every time you bite into them.</li>
<li>Coat the curls in equal parts cornstarch, soy sauce, oil, and a bit of garlic powder. You can also add application-specific seasoning at this stage. Thsi gives it a good base flavor and base salt level that will make them taste good but neutral by default, and they'll fit right into about anything after this. I've gotten better results salting them separately.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a skillet and then sautee the curls until the cornstarch browns. If you don't pre-heat the oil, the cornstarch will mix into the oil and it will get weird, the oil must be preheated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tossing in oil and the cornstarch helps 'insulate' the curls from external liquid. If you take pressed curls and put them in a soup or curry, they take on too much water in an unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Season them however and use them however from here, as you would cooked chicken.</p>
