definitely overdone on the focaccia and olive oil lately, and I've been
refining the mediterranean. I've done a similar menu sucessfully with kefte,
but this was my first time trying out the shawarma, and it worked out with
incredible success and positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="shawarma, hummus, salad, and pita laid out" src="http://varun-magesh.github.io/images/shawarma-spread.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soy curl shawarma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="shawarma close up" src="http://varun-magesh.github.io/images/shawarma.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new and excellent use of &lt;a href="https://www.butlerfoods.com"&gt;soy curls&lt;/a&gt; for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soaked and drained soy curls with a press; then, added lots of oil --- not
enough to immerse, but enough for a generous coat. I covered curls with a salty
powdered chicken broth and a touch of soy sauce to get a chicken-y atmosphere,
and then seasoned liberally with notes from a &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023019-cauliflower-shawarma-with-spicy-tahini"&gt;cauliflower shawarma
recipe&lt;/a&gt;; my own additions were kasuri methi, garam masala, and kashmiri red chili
powder. I let the whole situation marinate overnight, and then sauteed on
med-high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key, however, was &lt;strong&gt;braising with chickën broth&lt;/strong&gt; during the cook.
Normally, fried soy curls are a touch too dry, but letting them marinate in
watery liquid makes them soggy. Loosening up the pan with a splash of chickën
broth every so often kept the curls tender and not like fried-crispy dry, which
I think is what you want for shawarma. They also didn't get soggy/absorb too
much water, just stayed perfectly moist. Definitely doing this technique again
for other things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pita&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pita in oven" src="http://varun-magesh.github.io/images/pita.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016071-homemade-pita-bread"&gt;NYT recipe&lt;/a&gt;: make
a sponge w 2tsp yeast, a touch of sugar, 1 c. water, and ¼ c. each whole wheat
and apf. Let it get frothy for ~15 mins before adding ~2¼ c. apf, 1 tsp. salt,
2 tbsp. evoo; knead a bit, then let it rise for an hour or so. Make balls, roll
them out with a pin, 475 on a baking stone for ~3 mins with a flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some extra rosemary so I threw in some needles. There weren't a ton (it
should have been more rosemary-y) but the occasional touch of rosemary was
lovely. This is the first time I've also had the pocket form beautifully!
Definitely the stovetop does not work for that, you need the oven and a hot
stone/surface underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea for the future is a tepla pita; seasoning it well with some kasuri
methi and other things I think would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chopped Salad + Hummus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this I did a quick cucumber, tomato, and olive salad with pickled
onions and a lemony hummus. Nothing fancy there, but good complements for the
meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice touch was some leftover oil from confit tomatoes that was heavenly
poured over the top of little pita pockets; would highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Kitchen"></category></entry><entry><title>Focaccia, confit tomatoes, and a summer salad</title><link href="http://varun-magesh.github.io/focaccia-confit-tomatoes-and-a-summer-salad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-07-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Varun Magesh</name></author><id>tag:varun-magesh.github.io,2024-07-28:/focaccia-confit-tomatoes-and-a-summer-salad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted a summer lunch that was impressive but relatively hands off; I would

and I've been really into confit tomatoes recently, so I organized around nice
things to go with those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focaccia&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021036-focaccia?algo=cooking_search_relevance_metric_ios_and_web&amp;amp;fellback=false&amp;amp;imp_id=8359099581733063&amp;amp;req_id=764298173660429&amp;amp;surface=cooking-search-web&amp;amp;variant=0_relevance_reranking"&gt;NYT recipe&lt;/a&gt;): 415 grams flour, 420 grams water, 1/2 tsp yeast, 1 tbsp salt; overnight in the fridge, and 2 hours before in the pan. Brush with olive oil, indent with fingers, top with salt, and bake at 450 for ~30-40 minutes until golden brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one problem I've been having recently with focaccias in glass is sticking; this
time and last I've had to pry hard to get it out, even with generous olive oil.
I recall focaccia-type pizzas coming out nicely from the cast iron, so maybe I should
try there. Another option is parchment paper, though I worry that will also end up
sticking and there will be scraps of paper in the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the salad, I wanted something summery and lighter to contrast the bread.
Tart, but with a source of acidity that wasn't tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White bean salad&lt;/strong&gt;: White beans and a little rotini tossed in a basil &amp;amp; sunflower seed pesto mixed with Trader Joe's vegan yogurt, topped with thinly sliced cucumber, olives, and nice pickled onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the pesto + yogurt combination; it's something creamier that's
not as heavy as mayonnaise. However, I don't think the sunflower seeds worked
well with the pesto --- fine in a pinch without pine nuts/walnuts on hand, but
they imparted a kind of unpleasant musty taste. Maybe it's just these ones
specifically, they've been sitting in the pantry for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was excellent; the focaccia and confit definitely stole the show, but
the salad was still appreciated. Cooked for three and didn't end with many leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salad was also the right counterpoint to the focaccia on a hot day; the dressing
was also good mopped up with the nice bread.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Kitchen"></category></entry><entry><title>Panzanella, confit beans, &amp; cucumber salad</title><link href="http://varun-magesh.github.io/panzanella-confit-beans-cucumber-salad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-07-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Varun Magesh</name></author><id>tag:varun-magesh.github.io,2024-07-25:/panzanella-confit-beans-cucumber-salad.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="panzanella" src="http://varun-magesh.github.io/images/panzanella.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
